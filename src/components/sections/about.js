                Hi, I'm Mina.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm mostly a homebody who likes to build webpages and watch cartoons.
                I also enjoy coffee, cooking, and photography!
            </p>
            <p>
                I studied CS + Public Health @ UMD. Go terps lulz.
                I've worked at non-profits and in government contracting in the past, and I'm looking for orgs that tie into my interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                I value community and creative expression, so I like to volunteer 
                and find creative outlets. 
                Right now I'm learning more about security and taking a pottery class :)
            </p>

                I recently moved to the bay area and I would love to connect with others here!
