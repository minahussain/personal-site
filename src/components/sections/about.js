                I studied Computer Science + Public Health @ UMD. Go terps lulz.<br />
                I've worked at non-profits and in government contracting in the past, and I'm looking for orgs that tie into my interests.

                I value community and creative expression, so I like to volunteer 
                and find creative outlets.
