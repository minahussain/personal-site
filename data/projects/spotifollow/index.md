A web app that allows Spotify users to "follow" another user's playlist by copying their playlist so you can add or remove songs at your leisure. In the web app, users can update the playlist to match any changes made to the original playlist, while maintaining any of your removals or additions. Spotify recently added a "hide" feature in playlists to remove songs, but still with no functionality to add songs.
